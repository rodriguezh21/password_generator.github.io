# Password Generator

## A simple way of generating a secure password in a few clicks.


Password Generator Websites (PGW) are usually very basic and for the most part don't really have a lot of content to show, but just a button and a box for text. That doesn't there's not a lot happening in the back. 


A password generator is a tool that automatically generates a password based on guidelines that you set to create strong and unpredictable passwords for each of your accounts.
The Javascript code for PGW is not very extensive, a few lines of code will do just fine.

Good password generators do the following:

Adjust guidelines to fit different sites' unique password requirements
Generate strong passwords using secure technology with built-in randomness
Are integrated into a password manager like Dashlane to create, manage, and easily use all of your strong passwords

### About this project:

At first I thought this project was too advanced for the little knowledge I had in Javascript but the more time I spent looking at the code the more sense it made to me. 
The hardest part about this project was figuring out how to get the password to display in the text box.
